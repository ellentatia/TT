<h3>About</h3>
<p>Following the idea that in order to learn a language one needs to be exposed to it.
  Time tracker is a tool developed by <a href="https://www.thealmacollective.com/"><b>TAC - The Alma Collective</b></a> to help international parents to measure the amount of time their kids are exposed to their language.
  It is part of a workshop and became the Startup's to be first web app.</p>
  
 <h3>Technologies used</h3>
 <h5>FRONTEND
  <ul>
    <li>HTML 5</li>
    <p>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <p>Based on the Materialize css framework with customizations to adapt to TAC's style.</p>
    <li>Java Script</li>
    <p> For this app I used pure java script, no framework applied.</p>
   <li>Hosted on Heroku</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>BACKEND
    <ul>
      <li>Python, Flask</li>
      <p>Because of its lightness and simplicity, Flask was used as the webserver for this app.</p>
      <li>MongoDB</li>
      <p>It was my first attempt to use MongoBD. However, as we are still in the prototype version, we dont want to scare potential user from testing the app by asking them to login. Instead, we decided to hold it for the next version and use google analytics to measure and analyse traffic.</p>
    </ul>
      
 <h3>Conclusion</h3>
 <p> During this first experience developing and webapp, we, myself and the TAC team, gained new knowledge and are still learning by developing and improving this webapp.</p>
 <p>My personal challenges were:
  <li>Make it responsive, which means it should look great in all screen sizes.</li>
  <li>Style and structure: dealing with tables, grids </li>
  <li>However Materialize css framework was difficult to adapt to the client style, it was extremtly helpful at the begining of the developing processs.</li>
